Added dot badge. A dot badge notifies users of changes in state e.g. new messages, notifications, or updates. Also the position of the badge will be at top right center of the Button/Icon.

```tsx
<Badge>
  <Button aria-label="Notifications">
    <NotificationIcon aria-hidden />
  </Button>
</Badge>
```
