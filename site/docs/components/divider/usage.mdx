## Using the components

### When to use

- Use Divider to represent the thin line separating items.

### Best practices: 

- Primary dividers meet the 3:1 contrast ratio against Salt backgrounds, needed for graphical elements in WCAG 2.1. They are ideal to distinguish between interactive elements or between distinct interactions.
- Secondary dividers are ideal to distinguish between regions and containers.
- Tertiary dividers are suitable for less prominent separations between repeated elements, where a softer distinction is desired.
