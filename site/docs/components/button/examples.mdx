<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="Appearance">

## Appearance

Button supports multiple visual styles: `"solid"`, `"outline"` and `"transparent"`. `"solid"` is the default appearance.

</LivePreview>
  
<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="Color">

## Color

Button has a default color of `"neutral"`, it can be used for routine, nonurgent actions. You can use the `"accent"` color for high-priority actions or call-to-actions.

<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="IconAndText">

## Icon and text

Add an icon before the text to reinforce the button text. Add an icon after the button text to suggest movement or a direction.

### Best practices

- Place an icon to the left of the text to further describe the action, such as “upload”, “submit”, “play” or “done”. Additional description can make it easier for users to locate actions.
- Place an icon to the right of the text to suggest direction or movement, such as opening a menu overlay, expanding a panel or opening a document. When the user activates the button, there's typically an immediate visual change.

<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="IconOnly">

## Icon only

Display an icon-only button with no text when you have limited on-screen space, and users can easily understand the icon.

### Best practices

- An icon-only button should be self-explanatory, ideally using well-known symbols. If the button's purpose isn’t clear from the icon alone, add a text description.
- Use [`Tooltip`](../tooltip) on an icon-only button to describe the action, such as “Edit this form”, “Print this document”, or “Lock document state”.

<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="Disabled" >

## Disabled

Use the disabled state for a button that the user can’t press.

A button with the prop `disabled={true}` will suppress all functionality.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="FocusableWhenDisabled" >

## Focusable when disabled

If you need to allow the user to place focus on a disabled button, you also need to pass `focusableWhenDisabled={true}`.

This is useful when you want to show a tooltip or a popover when the user hovers over the button.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="FullWidth" >

## Full width

Use full width buttons on mobile devices or smaller viewports, the button will take up the full width of its container.

</LivePreview>
  
<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="CTA" displayName="CTA - Deprecated" >

## CTA

_Note:_ The `variant` prop is deprecated. Use `appearance="solid"` and `color="accent"` instead.

Use the CTA button for high-priority actions. For example, a CTA button may prompt a user to register, sign up, submit or buy.

### Best practices

Use CTA buttons sparingly. They represent the default or expected action on the page.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="Primary" displayName="Primary - Deprecated" >

## Primary

_Note:_ The `variant` prop is deprecated. Use `appearance="solid"` and `color="neutral"` instead.

This is the default variant. Use the primary button for routine, nonurgent actions, for example, to move to the next page or complete a task.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="Secondary" displayName="Secondary - Deprecated" >

## Secondary

_Note:_ The `variant` prop is deprecated. Use `appearance="transparent"` and `color="neutral"` instead.

Use the secondary button for noncritical actions that support the user but don't impact a flow. They're typically the alternative option available alongside a primary action. For example, a secondary “back” button may support a primary “next” button.
